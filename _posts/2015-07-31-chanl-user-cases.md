A list of use case for chanl. The chanl app is centered around the distribution of information to others. With this in mind we've made a list of what you can choose to use your chanl for.

* __Friend Groups__ : a chanl can be created with the purpose of bringing together ones network of friends at a single place. Once such chanl is created one can get to share information which he/she finds would interest them. Unlike sharing a post on a facebook wall where the post can get lost in lots of streams coming in from elsewhere, with chanl you are assured that the feed would be seen by the people who care.

* __Class Groups__: sharing information among student colleagues can be very difficult. Creating whatsapp groups partially looks at only the classmates you have and also some users that join don't really want to be flooded with irrelevant information on the group page (and they end up leaving). Chanl solves this through the use of feeds. Feeds can be created for each topic one wants and can create conversation within those feeds through unanimous chats. Don't worry you get to administer the group page as an admin and choose what someone can do within a chanl :)
 
* __Media Group__ : Phone calls, whatsapp, and twitter handles are all very good ways to reach out to your users. What if you want to really engage your users before and after a broadcast. Or you want to continually know the number of users who pay attention to your broadcast and how they react with issues that are being discussed. With a public group on chanl anyone can choose to join your chanl and leave, read information from you through feeds, and share their opinion through conversations on the feeds.

* __Banking Group__ : Recently attended an event(MINC TALKS) where various bankers were invited to give a talk about the banking system in the country and answering various questions from startups. One major issue from the audience was getting information from startups as it changes. With chanl, banking institutions can have feed that convey such information to their users. (eg. their current exchange rates, offers, services, and promotions). You'd just need to create a chanl broadcast (chanl panel) within your banking hall (or with the chanl sticker) to allow all your users interested in knowing more your service to get into it and ask questions.

* __Restaurant Groups__ : I am (Philip) really much excited about this. Imagine walking by a restaurant which has a chanl panel and getting all the menu being served for the day. And also giving the direct ability to give feedback on the food being served at a particular day.

* __etc__
