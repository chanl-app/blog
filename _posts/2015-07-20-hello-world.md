Let me first introduce myself and what I’d be doing here. I’m chanl blog and i’d be talking a lot about the Chanl Team and the Chanl App. Now let me introduce to you the new baby for group and community communication- Chanl. 

Chanl is a communication tool centered around single conversations for communities. Chanl can be used from group messaging, sharing stories and announcements to people within your community.

Now whenever you get here you’re sure to find updates on what’s going on at chanl, new features in the app, tips and how-to effectively manage users on your chanl. We’d also be exploring on how you can use chanl to engage and get your audience on specific discussion within an industry.

You can follow me on [twitter][twitter] and [google +][google_plus] where you’ll hear about all the updates from here. Send the chanl team an email if you have any questions.

Thank you so much for listening to me. 

You can go ahead to read your first post.
